      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // team[0] = "Wes1";

      // console.log({ team }, { players });
      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team1 = players.slice();
      team1[0] = "Wes2";
      console.log({ team1 }, { players });
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team2 = [].concat(players);
      team2[0] = "Wes3";
      console.log({ team2 }, { players });
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team3 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      console.log({ team3 });

      const team4 = Array.from(players);
      console.log({ team4 });
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const me = person;
      // me.number = 99;
      // console.log({ me }, { person });

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const me2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 10 });
      console.log({ me2 }, { person });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const me3 = { ...person };
      me3.number = 11;
      console.log({ me3 }, { person });

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      console.log(wes);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      dev.age = 10;

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      dev2.age = 20;
      console.log({ dev }, { dev2 });
